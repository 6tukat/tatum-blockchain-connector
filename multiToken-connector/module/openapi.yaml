      <p>MultiToken is a type of contract where multiple NFT or "non-fungible token" can be deployed with FT "Fungible Tokens". Non-fungible means that each token is unique and irreplaceable while Fungible tokens are tokens that have same value. This principle gives MultiToken their value and gives rise to a wide range of interesting potential use cases.<br/>
      MultiTokens can be used for nearly any digital asset or good to ensure authenticity and scarcity. The possibilities are endless, but here are a few example use cases:
      <ul>
      <li><b>In-game assets</b> - MultiTokens can be used to create unique collectibles in the form of characters, weapons, skins, or other equipment. Players can resell or trade assets directly as they choose, and their authenticity is easily verifiable. No more eBay, no more scammers.</li>
      <li><b>Music and other digital media</b> - MultiTokens can be used to create rare and unique collectible digital releases. Similarly, NFTs can be used to sell videos, art, or any other type of digital media. Collectors can own digital originals of their favorite songs, movies, or virtually anything else you can imagine.</li>
      <li><b>Digital sports merch</b> - Trading cards, memorabilia, classic moments in sports history, and one-of-a-kind experiences can also be sold as NFTs, opening up a world of possibilities for sports leagues and teams worldwide. The NBA Top Shot website sells collectible “moments” from the league’s history, and at the time of writing, the website is completely sold out and closed for new sign-ups.</li>
      <br/>
      These endpoints wraps up standard MultiToken implementation and operations, which can be done with them. Endpoints are blockchain agnostic, the only differentatior is the <b>chain</b> parameter in the URL path.<br/><br/>
      Tatum now supports MultiToken on these blockchains:<br/>
      <ul>
      <li><b>Ethereum</b></li>
      <li><b>Celo</b></li>
      <li><b>Flow</b></li>
      <li><b>Binance Smart Chain</b></li>
      </ul>

        <p>Deploy MultiToken Smart Contract. This method creates new ERC1155 Smart Contract (Non-Fungible MultiTokens) on the blockchain. Smart contract is standardized and audited.
        It is possible to mint, burn and transfer tokens. It is also possible to mint multiple tokens at once.<br/>
        Tatum now supports MultiTokens on these blockchains:<br/>
        <ul>
        <li><b>Ethereum</b></li>
        <li><b>Celo</b></li>
        <li><b>Flow</b></li>
        <li><b>Binance Smart Chain</b></li>
        </ul>

        This operation needs the private key of the blockchain address. Every time the funds are transferred, the transaction must be signed with the corresponding private key.
        No one should ever send it's own private keys to the internet because there is a strong possibility of stealing keys and loss of funds. In this method, it is possible to enter privateKey
        or signatureId. PrivateKey should be used only for quick development on testnet versions of blockchain when there is no risk of losing funds. In production,
        <a href="https://github.com/tatumio/tatum-kms" target="_blank">Tatum KMS</a> should be used for the highest security standards, and signatureId should be present in the request.
        Alternatively, using the Tatum client library for supported languages or Tatum Middleware with a custom key management system is possible.

        <p>Transfer MultiToken Tokens from account to account. Transfer any NFT token from smart contract defined in contractAddress.
        Multiple token with specified tokenIds and values can be transfered. This method invokes ERC721 method safeTransfer() to transfer the token in case of ETH, Celo and BSC.<br/><br/>
        Tatum now supports MultiTokens these blockchains:<br/>
        <ul>
        <li><b>Ethereum</b></li>
        <li><b>Flow</b></li>
        <li><b>Celo</b></li>
        <li><b>Binance Smart Chain</b></li>
        </ul>
        This operation needs the private key of the blockchain address. Every time the funds are transferred, the transaction must be signed with the corresponding private key.
        No one should ever send it's own private keys to the internet because there is a strong possibility of stealing keys and loss of funds. In this method, it is possible to enter privateKey
        or signatureId. PrivateKey should be used only for quick development on testnet versions of blockchain when there is no risk of losing funds. In production,
        <a href="https://github.com/tatumio/tatum-kms" target="_blank">Tatum KMS</a> should be used for the highest security standards, and signatureId should be present in the request.
        Alternatively, using the Tatum client library for supported languages or Tatum Middleware with a custom key management system is possible.
